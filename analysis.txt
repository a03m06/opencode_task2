Task 2: Neural Network from Scratch

Model Architecture:
A simple fully connected neural network with two hidden layers
was designed and trained from scratch. The network uses ReLU
activation functions and a final softmax-based classification
layer.

Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset was used. Images were flattened into
one-dimensional vectors before being fed into the network.

Training Observations:
Training accuracy increased steadily across epochs, indicating
that the network was able to learn meaningful patterns from
the data. However, test accuracy was significantly lower than
training accuracy.

Generalization Analysis:
The gap between training and test accuracy suggests that the
model overfits the training data. This is expected since a
fully connected network does not exploit spatial features
present in images.

Failure Analysis:
The model struggles to distinguish visually similar classes
due to the lack of convolutional layers. Flattening images
removes spatial information, limiting generalization.

Conclusion:
This experiment highlights the limitations of training a
neural network from scratch on image data. Compared to
transfer learning with convolutional networks, simple neural
networks show weaker generalization and higher overfitting.
